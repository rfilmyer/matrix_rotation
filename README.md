# matrix_rotation
A shiny app demonstrating rotation matrices and how they are linear transformations.

I made this app for a presentation for my Statistical Inference class as a review of some linear algebra concepts. 

[I deployed the app here!](https://rfilmyer-ncf.shinyapps.io/linear_transformation/)
